# Computer Animation: Assignment 1 Cardinal Spline 计算机动画课程作业：Cardinal样条曲线
# Created by Yunzhe with WebStorm.
This project is done, I think.
A simple HTML page named "spline.html" is generated for previewing some functions.
You can also start the server with Python + Flask.
Everyone is allowed to take a look at the algorithm in class CdnSpline@model.js.
The project is under MIT licence.

Wish you good luck.

使用jCanvas实现，而非Three.js。
你可以使用Flask跑一个本地server，或者直接打开spline.html。
使用了MIT协议。

玩得愉快。
